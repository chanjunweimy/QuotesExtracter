Wall Street wizard George Soros, whose speculation helped crack the pound in
last September's currency chaos, sounded a retreat from the mark yesterday by
telling the world he was selling the German currency.

The billionaire philanthropist, who has convinced financial markets of his Midas
touch, said in an article published in the Times of London newspaper that he
expected the mark to fall against all major currencies.

The effect was immediate and helped confirm his guru status. Traders sold marks
in the morning and the German currency fell about a pfennig to 1.6335 to the US$
in Europe before recovering slightly at mid-session to around 1.6320.

''For the sake of full disclosure,'' Soros, 62, said in the article, ''I am
talking my book.''

That was a way of saying he was aware of the effect his article could have and
that he was not without a vested interest.

A Hungarian-born Jew whose family went into hiding during the Second World War,
Soros has hit the headlines only in the past year, but his past successes are
legendary in the markets.

Soros named his investment fund Quantum after Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, which asserts the impossibility of predicting the behavior of
sub-atomic particles in quantum mechanics. His pinpoint forecasting belies this
little joke.

As a fund manager, he has a reputation for providing handsome profit. If an
investor had put US$100,000 in Quantum in 1969 and had reinvested the annual
dividends, that investor now would be worth well in excess of US$80 million.

An intellectual who studied philosophy at the London School of Economics, Soros
has advocated a common European currency.

''The fact that it would put speculators like me out of business is one of its
merits,'' he said in the Times article.

Analysts say he has few peers in understanding market psychology and has
well-informed and formidable contacts throughout the banking world. But his
activities are shrouded in secrecy as he shuttles between offices in London and
New York.

Soros took the world by storm last September as ''The Man Who Broke the Pound''
after funds he managed made almost US$1 billion when sterling was forced from
the European Community's Exchange Rate Mechanism currency grid by a wave of
speculation.

He bet heavily that the pound would not hold its allotted value and then watched
as it tumbled 20% in value.

His subsequent coups in gold and property were not made by buying at the bottom
of the market and analysts said the mark had been seen as a ''loser''.
